# Root Snake

In Root Snake, players take control of roots as they grow endlessly downward, avoiding rocks and underground animals to get as much nutrients as possible from the soil. There's no stopping on the way down, so this will be a true test of your reflexes. Points are awarded for digging into darker, nutrient rich soil and defeating root-eating rabbits. Just how far will you make it?
